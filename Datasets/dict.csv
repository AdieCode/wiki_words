Italianate,"The Italianate style was a distinct 19th-century phase in the history of Classical architecture. Like Palladianism and Neoclassicism, the Italianate style drew its inspiration from the models and architectural vocabulary of 16th-century Italian Renaissance architecture, synthesising these with picturesque aesthetics. The style of architecture that was thus created, though also characterised as ""Neo-Renaissance"", was essentially of its own time. ""The backward look transforms its object,"" Siegfried Giedion wrote of historicist architectural styles;[2] ""every spectator at every period—at every moment, indeed—inevitably transforms the past according to his own nature.""

"
chromophores,"A chromophore is the part of a molecule responsible for its color.[2]
The color that is seen by our eyes is the one not absorbed by the reflecting object within a certain wavelength spectrum of visible light. The chromophore is a region in the molecule where the energy difference between two separate molecular orbitals falls within the range of the visible spectrum. Visible light that hits the chromophore can thus be absorbed by exciting an electron from its ground state into an excited state.  In biological molecules that serve to capture or detect light energy, the chromophore is the moiety that causes a conformational change in the molecule when hit by light.
