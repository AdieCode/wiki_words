languishing,"Flourishing, or human flourishing, is the complete goodness of humans in a developmental life-span, that somehow includes positive psychological functioning and positive social functioning, along with other basic goods. The term has gained more usage and interest in recent times, but is rooted in ancient philosophical and theological usages. Aristotle’s term eudaimonia is one source for understanding human flourishing. The Hebrew Scriptures, or the Old Testament, also speak of flourishing, as they compare the just person to a growing tree. Christian Scriptures, or the New Testament, build upon Jewish usage and speak of flourishing as it can exist in heaven. The medieval theologian Thomas Aquinas drew from Aristotle as well as the Bible, and utilized the notion of flourishing in his philosophical theology. More recently, the Positive Psychology of Martin Seligman, Corey Keyes, Barbara Fredrickson, and others, have expanded and developed the notion of human flourishing. Empirical studies, such as those of the Harvard Human Flourishing Program, and practical applications, indicate the importance of the concept and the increasingly widespread use of the term in business, economics, and politics. In positive psychology, flourishing is ""when people experience positive emotions, positive psychological functioning and positive social functioning, most of the time,""[1] living ""within an optimal range of human functioning.""[2] It is a descriptor and measure of positive mental health and overall life well-being,[2][3] and includes multiple components and concepts, such as cultivating strengths, subjective well-being, ""goodness, generativity, growth, and resilience.""[2] In this view, flourishing is the opposite of both pathology and languishing, which are described as living a life that feels hollow and empty.

cryosphere,"The cryosphere (from the Greek κρύος kryos, ""cold"", ""frost"" or ""ice"" and σφαῖρα sphaira, ""globe, ball""[1]) is an all-encompassing term for those portions of Earth's surface where water is in solid form, including sea ice, lake ice, river ice, snow cover, glaciers, ice caps, ice sheets, and frozen ground (which includes permafrost). Thus, there is a wide overlap with the hydrosphere. The cryosphere is an integral part of the global climate system with important linkages and feedbacks generated through its influence on surface energy and moisture fluxes, clouds, precipitation, hydrology, atmospheric and oceanic circulation. Through these feedback processes, the cryosphere plays a significant role in the global climate and in climate model response to global changes. Approximately 10% of the Earth's surface is covered by ice, but this is rapidly decreasing.[2] The term deglaciation describes the retreat of cryospheric features. Cryology is the study of cryospheres.

Clans, in indigenous societies, tend to be endogamous, meaning that their members can marry one another. Clans preceded[citation needed] more centralized forms of community organization and government, and exist in every country.[citation needed] Members may identify with a coat of arms or other symbol to show that they are an independent clan[clarify]. Kinship-based groups may also have a symbolic ancestor, whereby the clan shares a ""stipulated"" common ancestor who serves as a symbol of the clan's unity.

Neodymium,"Neodymium is a chemical element with the symbol Nd and atomic number 60. It is the fourth member of the lanthanide series and is considered to be one of the rare-earth metals. It is a hard, slightly malleable, silvery metal that quickly tarnishes in air and moisture. When oxidized, neodymium reacts quickly producing pink, purple/blue and yellow compounds in the +2, +3 and +4 oxidation states. It is generally regarded as having one of the most complex spectra of the elements.[6] Neodymium was discovered in 1885 by the Austrian chemist Carl Auer von Welsbach, who also discovered praseodymium. It is present in significant quantities in the minerals monazite and bastnäsite. Neodymium is not found naturally in metallic form or unmixed with other lanthanides, and it is usually refined for general use. Neodymium is fairly common—about as common as cobalt, nickel, or copper—and is widely distributed in the Earth's crust.[7] Most of the world's commercial neodymium is mined in China, as is the case with many other rare-earth metals.

Rafts are usually kept afloat by using any combination of buoyant materials such as wood, sealed barrels, or inflated air chambers (such as pontoons), and are typically not propelled by an engine. Rafts are an ancient mode of transport; naturally-occurring rafts such as entwined vegetation and pieces of wood have been used to traverse water since the dawn of humanity.
"
ranked,"A ranking is a relationship between a set of items such that, for any two items, the first is either ""ranked higher than"", ""ranked lower than"", or ""ranked equal to"" the second.[1] In mathematics, this is known as a weak order or total preorder of objects. It is not necessarily a total order of objects because two different objects can have the same ranking. The rankings themselves are totally ordered. For example, materials are totally preordered by hardness, while degrees of hardness are totally ordered. If two items are the same in rank it is considered a tie.
